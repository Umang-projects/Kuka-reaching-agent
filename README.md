# Kuku-reaching-agent
### AI-Powered Motion Planning for a Robotic Arm
This project demonstrates a neural network, built with PyTorch, that learns to control a 6-DOF KUKA robotic arm in the PyBullet physics simulator. The agent's task is to perform a fundamental robotics skill: reaching a specific 3D target coordinate in its workspace.
The project's core is a supervised learning approach where a fast, reflexive neural network is trained to approximate the results of a traditional, slower Inverse Kinematics (IK) solver.

### Final Result
Here is the fully trained agent successfully reaching a target within its learned workspace. The entire motion is generated by the neural network's predictions.

### The Learning Journey: Overcoming the "Collapsing Robot"
A key challenge during development was that my initial agent would only learn to collapse on itself instead of reaching. This was not a bug in the code, but a fascinating problem with the training data.

### The Root Cause:
The training process involved asking an Inverse Kinematics solver for the "correct" joint angles for a randomly generated target. I discovered that when the random target was physically unreachable, the IK solver would "fail" and return a default, collapsed pose. The agent was therefore being taught that "collapsing" was a valid response.

### My Solution:
This became an exercise in data engineering. I implemented a two-part solution to generate high-quality training data:
State Reset: At the beginning of every training episode, I programmatically reset the robot to a clean, neutral pose. This gave the IK solver a consistent and fair starting point to find a valid solution.

Workspace-Aware Sampling: I engineered a "smarter" target generator. Instead of picking points in a random cube, it samples points from a reachable semi-circular volume in front of the robot.

This process of diagnosing and fixing the training data itself was a huge learning experience and resulted in a much more intelligent and accurate final agent.
